The objective of the game, "Goomba's Revenge," is to have Mario avoid the Goombas. To do so, one controls Mario by moving the mouse. Mario will closely follow the mouse cursor and the enemies will follow Mario. If the enemies collide with Mario, the health of the player, which is indicated by a bar at the top, will decrease. When the health bar reaches zero, the game will end. The score will continue to increase as long as the player is alive. So, the goal is to keep Mario alive for as long as possible to achieve a high score. 

Controls: 
 - Mouse: movement will control Mario's movement
 - Mouse Click: restarts game (resets score, resets Mario's position, and resets the Goombas' positions)
